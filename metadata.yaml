description: William Dean Howells frequently drew on his Midwestern childhood for
  his fiction. Based on an incident in Ohio that had always fascinated him, The Leatherwood
  God tells the intriguing tale of how a charlatan named Joseph Dylks, claiming to
  be a messenger of God (or even God himself), exploited the pious townspeople, split
  their devout community in two, and then disappeared.
